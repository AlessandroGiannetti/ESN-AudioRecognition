# ESN-AudioRecognition
Neural Network Project


Echo State Networks (ESN) are very simple to implement and are readily provided by many libraries on the network.
The aim of the project is to test whether ESNs can be useful tools for the audio data classification problem. 
For this purpose we developed an application for the classification of different types of construction vehicles and tools, through an Echo State Network. The proposed approach consists in splitting the audio data into fragments and sampling them into spectrogram representation to then be classified into the different types of machinery. This approach exhibited great potential in environmental sound classification (ESC) achieving significant accuracy.
